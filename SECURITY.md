## üö® Reporting a Vulnerability
I take all security reports seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, I appreciate your help in disclosing it responsibly.

> **Important:** Please **do not** open a public issue or pull request to report a security issue.

Instead, use **GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature**. This ensures the vulnerability is **not publicly disclosed** until a fix is in place.

### How to Submit a Private Report
1. Navigate to the **main page** of this repository.
2. Click on the **"Security"** tab.
3. In the left sidebar, click on **"Report a vulnerability"**.
4. Fill out the form with a detailed description of the vulnerability, including **steps to reproduce** if possible.

This will send a **private, encrypted report** directly to me. I will do my best to provide an **initial response within 48 hours** and will keep you updated on the progress of any patches.
