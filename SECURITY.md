In the left sidebar, click on "Report a vulnerability".

Fill out the form with the details of the vulnerability.

This will send a private report directly to me. I will do my best to respond to your report within 48 hours and will keep you updated on the progress of any fixes.

Thank you for helping to keep this project safe.
