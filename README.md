ü§ñ AI-Powered Financial News Sentiment Analyzer
Live Demo: [Link to your deployed Streamlit App will go here]

üöÄ Overview
This web application provides real-time sentiment analysis for financial news related to any stock ticker. It was built to demonstrate skills in Python, AI/ML model integration, API usage, and modern web app development. The app fetches the latest news headlines and uses a sophisticated AI model (FinBERT), specifically trained on financial text, to score each headline as positive, negative, or neutral.

This project fulfills a key promise made on my professional CV and showcases my ability to rapidly build and deploy data-driven tools.
